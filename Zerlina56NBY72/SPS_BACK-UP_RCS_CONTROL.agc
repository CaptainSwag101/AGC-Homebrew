## Purpose:     A log section of Zerlina 56, the final revision of
##              Don Eyles's offline development program for the variable 
##              guidance period servicer. It also includes a new P66 with LPD 
##              (Landing Point Designator) capability, based on an idea of John 
##              Young's. Neither of these advanced features were actually flown,
##              but Zerlina was also the birthplace of other big improvements to
##              Luminary including the terrain model and new (Luminary 1E)
##              analog display programs. Zerlina was branched off of Luminary 145,
##              and revision 56 includes all changes up to and including Luminary
##              183. It is therefore quite close to the Apollo 14 program,
##              Luminary 178, where not modified with new features.

# PROGRAM NAME:  SPSRCS

# AUTHOR:  EDGAR M. OSHIKA (AC ELECTRONICS)

# MODIFIED:  TO RETURN TO ALL AXES VIA Q BY P.S.WEISSMAN, OCT 7, 1968

# MODIFIED TO IMPROVE BENDING STABILITY BY G.KALAN,FEB.14,1969
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:

# THIS PROGRAM CONTROLS THE FIRING OF ALL RCS JETS IN THE DOCKED CONFIGURATION ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING PHASE
# PLANE LOGIC.

# 1. JET SENSE TEST (SPSRCS)

# IF JETS ARE FIRING NEGATIVELY,SET OLDSENSE NEGATIVE AND CONTINUE
# IF JETS ARE FIRING POSITIVELY,SET OLDSENSE POSITIVE AND CONTINUE
# IF JETS ARE NOT FIRING,SET OLDSENSE TO ZERO AND GO TO OUTER RATE LIMIT  TEST

# 2. RATE DEAD BAND TEST

# IF JETS ARE FIRING NEGATIVELY AND RATE IS GREATER THAN TARGET RATE,LEAVE
# JETS ON AND GO TO INHIBITION LOGIC. OTHERWISE,CONTINUE.
# IF JETS ARE FIRING POSITIVELY AND RATE IS   LESS  THAN TARGET RATE,LEAVE
# JETS ON AND GO TO INHIBITION LOGIC. OTHERWISE,CONTINUE.

# 3. OUTER RATE LIMIT TEST (SPSSTART)

# IF MAGNITUDE OF EDOT IS GREATER THAN 1.73 DEG/SEC SET JET FIRING TIME
#  TO REDUCE RATE AND GO TO INHIBITION LOGIC. OTHERWISE,CONTINUE.

# 4. COAST ZONE TEST

# IF STATE (E,EDOT) IS BELOW LINE  E + 4 X EDOT > -1.4 DEG  AND EDOT IS LESS THAN 1.30 DEG/SEC SET JET TIME POSI-
# TIVE AND CONTINUE. OTHERWISE,SET JET FIRING TIME TO ZERO AND CONTINUE.
# IF STATE IS ABOVE LINE  E + 4X EDOT > +1.4 DEG AND EDOT IS GREATER THAN -1.30 DEG/SEC, SET JET TIME NEGATIVE
# AND CONTINUE. OTHERWISE,SET JET FIRING TIME TO ZERO AND CONTINUE.

# 5. INHIBITION LOGIC

# IF OLDSENSE IS NON-ZERO:
#       A) RETURN IF JET TIME HAS SAME SIGN AS OLDSENSE
#       B) SET INHIBITION COUNTER*AND RETURN IF JET TIME IS ZERO
#       C) SET INHIBITION COUNTER,*SET JET TIME TO ZERO AND RETURN IF SIGN
#          OF JET TIME IS OPPOSITE TO THAT OF OLDSENSE

# IF OLDSENSE IS ZERO:
#       A) RETURN IF INHIBITION COUNTER IS NOT POSITIVE
#       B) SET JET TIME TO ZERO AND RETURN IF INHIBITION COUNTER IS POSITIVE
# *NOTE: INHIBITION COUNTERS CAN BE SET TO 4 OR 10 FOR THE P,AND UV AXES,
# RESPECTIVELY,IN SPSRCS. THEY ARE DECREMENTED BY ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF
## Page 1496
# EACH DAP PASS.

# THE MINIMUM PULSE WIDTH OF THIS CONTROLLER IS DETERMINED BY THE REPETITION  RATE AT WHICH THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED
# AND IS NOMINALLY 100 MS FOR ALL AXES IN DRIFTING FLIGHT.   DURING POWERED FLIGHT THE MINIMUM IS 100 MS FOR THE
# P AXIS AND 200 MS FOR THE CONTROL OF THE U AND V AXES.

# CALLING SEQUENCE:

#          INHINT
#                     TC     IBNKCALL
#                     CADR   SPSRCS


# EXIT:
#          TC     Q
# ALARM/ABORT MODE:    NONE

# SUBROUTINES CALLED:    NONE

# INPUT:      E,EDOT
#             TJP, TJV, TJU                   TJ MUST NOT BE NEGATIVE ZERO

# OUTPUT:     TJP, TJV, TJU
