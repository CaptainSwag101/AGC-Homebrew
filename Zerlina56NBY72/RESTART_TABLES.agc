## Purpose:     A log section of Zerlina 56, the final revision of
##              Don Eyles's offline development program for the variable 
##              guidance period servicer. It also includes a new P66 with LPD 
##              (Landing Point Designator) capability, based on an idea of John 
##              Young's. Neither of these advanced features were actually flown,
##              but Zerlina was also the birthplace of other big improvements to
##              Luminary including the terrain model and new (Luminary 1E)
##              analog display programs. Zerlina was branched off of Luminary 145,
##              and revision 56 includes all changes up to and including Luminary
##              183. It is therefore quite close to the Apollo 14 program,
##              Luminary 178, where not modified with new features.

# RESTART TABLES

# ------------------
#
# THERE ARE TWO FORMS OF RESTART TABLES FOR EACH GROUP.  THEY ARE KNOWN AS THE EVEN RESTART TABLES AND THE ODD
# RESTART TABLES.  THE ODD TABLES HAVE ONLY ONE ENTRY OF THREE LOCATIONS WHILE THE EVEN TABLES HAVE TWO ENTRIES
# EACH USING THREE LOCATIONS. THE INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS A JOB, WAITLIST, OR A LONGCALL IS GIVEN BY THE
# WAY THINGS ARE PUT INTO THE TABLES.
#      A JOB HAS ITS PRIORITY STORED IN PRDTTAB OF THE CORRECT PHASE SPOT - A POSITIVE PRIORITY INDICATES A
# FINDVAC JOB, A NEGATIVE PRIORITY A NOVAC.  THE 2CADR OF THE JOB IS STORED IN THE CADRTAB.
# FOR EXAMPLE,
#
#                                         5.7SPOT  OCT    23000
#                                                  2CADR  SOMEJOB
#
# A RESTART OF GROUP 5 WITH PHASE SEVEN WOULD THEN CAUSE SOMEJOB TO BE RESTARTED AS A FINDVAC WITH PRIORITY 23.

#                                         5.5SPOT  OCT    -23000
#                                                  2CADR  ANYJOB

# HERE A RESTART OF GROUP 5 WITH PHASE 7 WOULD CAUSE ANYJOB TO BE RESTARTED AS A NOVAC WITH PRIORITY 23.
# A LONGCALL HAS ITS GENADR OF ITS 2CADR STORED NEGATIVELY AND ITS BBCON STORED POSITIVELY.  IN ITS PRDTTAB IS
# PLACED THE LOCATION OF A DP REGISTER THAT CONTAINS THE DELTA TIME THAT LONGCALL HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY STARTED
# WITH.  EXAMPLE,
#
#                                         3.6SPOT  GENADR DELTAT
#                                                 -GENADR LONGTASK
#                                                  BBCON  LONGTASK

#                                                  OCT    31000
#                                                  2CADR  JOBAGAIN

# THIS WOULD START UP LONGTASK AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, OR IMMEDIATELY IF THE TIME HAD ALREADY PASSED. IT SHOULD
# BE NOTED THAT IF DELTAT IS IN A SWITCHED E BANK, THIS INFORMATOIN SHOULD BE IN THE BBCON OFTHE 2CADR OF THE
# TASK.  FROM ABOVE, WE SEE THAT THE SECOND PART OF THIS PHASE WOULD BE STARTED AS A JOB WITH A PRIORITY OF 31.
#
# WAITLIST CALLS ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THEIR 2CADR IS STORED NEGATIVELY. IF PRDTTAB OF THE PHASE SPOT
# IS POSITIVE, THEN IT CONTAINS THE DELTA TIME, IF PRDTTAB IS NEGATIVE THEN IT IS THE -GENADR OF AN ERASABLE
# LOCATION CONTAINING THE DELTA TIME, THAT IS, THE TIME IS STORED INDIRECTLY.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED AS ABOVE, THAT
# IF THE TIME IS STORED INDIRECTLY, THE BBCON MUST CONTAIN THE NECESSARY E BANK INFORMATION IF APPLICABLE.  WITH
# WAITLIST WE HAVE ONE FURTHER OPTION, IF -0 IS STORED IN PRDTTAB, IT WILL CAUSE AN IMMEDIATE RESTART OF THE
# TASK.  EXAMPLES,
#
#                                                  OCT    77777           THIS WILL CAUSE AN IMMEDIATE RESTART
#                                                 -2CADR  ATASK           OF THE TASK :ATASK:
#    
#                                                  DEC    200             IF THE TIME OF THE 2 SECONDS SINCE DUMMY
#                                                 -2CADR  DUMMY           WAS PUT ON WAITLIST IS UP, IT WILL BEGIN
#                                                                         IN 10 MS, OTHERWISE IT WILL BEGIN WHEN
#                                                                         IT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE BEGUN.
