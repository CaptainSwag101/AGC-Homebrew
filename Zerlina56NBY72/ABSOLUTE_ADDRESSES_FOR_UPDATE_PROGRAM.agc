## Purpose:     A log section of Zerlina 56, the final revision of
##              Don Eyles's offline development program for the variable 
##              guidance period servicer. It also includes a new P66 with LPD 
##              (Landing Point Designator) capability, based on an idea of John 
##              Young's. Neither of these advanced features were actually flown,
##              but Zerlina was also the birthplace of other big improvements to
##              Luminary including the terrain model and new (Luminary 1E)
##              analog display programs. Zerlina was branched off of Luminary 145,
##              and revision 56 includes all changes up to and including Luminary
##              183. It is therefore quite close to the Apollo 14 program,
##              Luminary 178, where not modified with new features.
