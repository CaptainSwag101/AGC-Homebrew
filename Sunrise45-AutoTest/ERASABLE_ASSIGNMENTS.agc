#	THE FOLLOWING STORAGE IS TIME-SHARED BY MISSION PROGRAMS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MASTER COMTROL. IT IS
# ORGANIZED INTO THREE PARTS REFERRED TO AS A MEMORY, B MEMORY, AND C MEMORY. A PARTICULAR MISSION PHASE IS
# ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE SEGMENTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO OTHER MISSION PHASE USING THE SAME SEGMENT WILL EVER RUN
# CONCURRENTLY; E.G., RE-ENTRY WILL NEVER RUN CONCURRENT WITH TVC. THE NUMBER OF AREAS (3) IS DETERMINED BY THE
# MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DISTINCT MISSION PROGRAMS WHICH RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY.
#
#	A MEMORY IS USED BY PRELAUNCH AND IN-FLIGHT ALIGNMENTS. B MEMORY IS USED BY MID-COURSE DURING FREE-FALL
# PORTIONS OF THE MISSION. THE C MEMORY PORTION IS USED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE MISSION FOR THE MIDCOURSE ERROR
# TRANSITION MATRIX W. THE EXCEPTION IS SYSTEM TEST, ASSIGNED TO A MEMORY, WHICH NEVER RUNS CONCURRENTLY WITH
# MISSION PROGRAMS.
