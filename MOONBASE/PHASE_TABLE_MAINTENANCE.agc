## Purpose:     This program is designed to extensively test the Apollo Guidance Computer
##              (specifically the LM instantiation of it). It is built on top of a heavily
##              stripped-down Aurora 12, with all code ostensibly added by the DAP Group
##              removed. Instead Borealis expands upon the tests provided by Aurora,
##              including corrected tests from Retread 44 and tests from Ron Burkey's
##              Validation.

# 	THE FOLLOWING ROUTINES ARE PROVIDED TO MAINTAIN THE PHASE TABLE. TWO ROUTINES ARE AVAILABLE:

#		TC	PHASCHNG	SLOWER BUT LESS STORAGE.
#		OCT	PPPGG		CHANGE RESTART GROUP GG TO PHASE PPP
#					(PPP IS A SIGNED 8 BIT NUMBER).

#		CA	PPPPP		NEW PHASE ARRIVES IN A.
#		TC	NEWPHASE
#		OCT	000GG		UPDATES GG.

#	IN ALL CASES THE OLD PHASE RETURNS IN A. IF THE OLD PHASE WAS NEGATIVE, CALL A ROUTINE USING THE
# CORRESPONDING TERMCADR.
