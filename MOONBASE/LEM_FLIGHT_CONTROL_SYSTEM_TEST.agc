## Purpose:     This program is designed to extensively test the Apollo Guidance Computer
##              (specifically the LM instantiation of it). It is built on top of a heavily
##              stripped-down Aurora 12, with all code ostensibly added by the DAP Group
##              removed. Instead Borealis expands upon the tests provided by Aurora,
##              including corrected tests from Retread 44 and tests from Ron Burkey's
##              Validation.
## Assembler:   yaYUL
## Contact:     Mike Stewart <mastewar1@gmail.com>.

## Mod history: 2016-12-20 MAS  Created from Aurora 12 (with much DAP stuff removed).

# LEM FCS TEST   RCS JETSET TASK
#     THIS JOB ISSUES A PROFILE OF  JET ON-OFF SIGNALS AS DETERMINED BY THE CONSTANTS IN A SET OF SIX REGISTERS.
# THE SIX REGISTERS ARE, (1) NTIMES, THE NUMBER OF TIMES A PARTICULAR STEP WILL BE PERFORMED. (2) NEXTTIME, THE
# TIME BETWEEN STEPS, A MAXIMUM OF 2 MINUTES, (3) JETONTM, THE TIME TO TURN THE JETS ON, SCALED FOR T3, (4) JET-
# OFFTM, THE TIME AFTER ONTM TO TURN THE JETS OFF, (5) XJETS, THE PARTICULAR X JETS TO BE TURNED ON AND OFF
# DURING EACH REPEAT OF A STEP, AND (6) YZJETS,, THE Y AND Z JETS TO BE TURNED ON AND OFF DURING EACH REPEAT OF A
# STEP.  XJETS AND YZJETS MUST BE IN THE SAME FORMAT AS CHANNELS 5 AND6 RESPECTIVELY.  THERE ARE EIGHT SETS OF
# THESE SIX REGISTERS.
#     THE REGISTER JETSTEP IS USED TO INDEX THE 8 SETS OF REGISTERS, THE ALLOWABLE VALUES OF JETSTEP ARE +0 THRU 7
#     THIS JOB WILL BE ENTERED BUT IMMEDIATELY ENDED IF THE INITIAL VALUES OF JETSTEP AND NTIMES ARE +0.

# LEM FCS TEST  TRIM TASK
# THIS PROGRAM ISSUES A PROFILE OF PITCH AND ROLL TRIM COMMANDS TO THE LEM DESCENT ENGINE GIMBAL IN ACCORDANCEWITH
# THE VALUE S IN THE TRIMSTEP REGISTER AND THE 12 SETS OF 5 REGISTERS CALLED NUMTIMES, STEPDLYT, TRIMONT, TRIMOFFT
# AND TRIMIND.  TRIMSTEP IS USED TO PICK UP A PARTICULAR SET OF THE 5 REGISTERS AND HAS ALLOWABLE VALUES FROM +0
# THROUGH +11 DECIMAL.  THE 5 REGISTERS IN EACH SET ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS
#     (1) NUMTIMES DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE COMMAND IN TRIMIND  WILL BE ISSUED.  VALUES FROM +0 TO
# OCT 37777 ARE PERMITTED.
#     (2) STEPDLYT DETERMINES THE TIME BETWEEN THE START OF A STEP AND THE BEGINNING OF TRIMONT.  STEPDLYT MUST BE
# FORMATTED FOR T3, ITS MAXIMUM VALUE IS 2 MINUTES.
#     (3) TRIMONT DETERMINES THE TIME BETWEEN THE END OF STEPDLYT OR TRIMOFFT AND THE TIME THE TRIM COMMANDS ARE
# ISSUED.  IT MUST BE FORMATTED FOR T3.
#     (4) TRIMOFFT DETERMINES THE LENGTH OF TIME THE TRIM COMMAND WILL BE ON, FORMATTED FOR T3.
#     (5) TRIMIND DETERMINES THE PITCH AND ROLL COMMAND TO BE ISSUED.  THE FORMAT IS, BIT9=1=+ PITCH COMMAND,
# BIT10=1=-PITCH, BIT11=1= +ROLL, BIT12=1= -ROLL.  A BIT=0 INDICATES NO COMMAND.  ANY COMBINATION OF COMMANDS IS
# PERMITTED.
#    THIS TASK WILL BE ENTERED BUT IMMEDIATELY ENDED IF TRIMSTEP AND NUMTIMES = +0.

# LEM FCS TEST  THROTTLE TASK

# VALUES OF +0 THROUGH +5.  THE 5 REGISTERS PER SET ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS
#     (1) DOTIMES DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE THROTTLE WILL BE EXERCISED AS PER THE VALUES OF THR1TIME,
# THCOMM1 AND THCOMM2 OF THE CURRENT STEP.  IT HAS ALLOWABLE VALUES OF +0 THROUGH 37777 OCT.
#     (2) DELAY DETERMINES THE TIME BETWEEN THE START OF A STEP AND THE BE GINNING OF THR1TIME. ITIS CALLED ONLY
# ONCE PER STEP,I.E., REPEATS OF THE SAME THCOMM1 AND THCOMM2 START AT THR1TIME.  DELAY MUST BE FORMATTED FOR T3
# AND HENCE HAS A MAXIMUM VALUE OF 2 MINUTES.
#     (3) THR1TIME DETERMINES THE TIME BETWEEN THE END OF DELAY OR THE END   OF THCOMM2 AND THE START OF
# THCOMM1.  IT MUST BE FORMATTED FOR T3.
#     (4) THCOMM1 AND (5) THCOMM2 DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF THRUST INCREASE  OR DECREASE PULSES TOBE ISSUED AT A
# 3.2KPPS RATE.  THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE VALUES OF EITHER IS FROM POSMAX (OCT 37777) TO NEGMAX (OCT 40000) ALTHOUGH
# THE ACTUAL THROTTLE RANGE IS FROM OCT 6116 TO OCT 71661 (+,- 3150 DEC).
#    THIS TASK WILL BE ENTERED BUT IMMEDIATELY ENDED IF THE INITIAL VALUES OF THRTSTEP AND DOTIMES ARE +0.

# LEM FCS TEST  INTERFACE LOOK TASK.

#     THIS PROGRAM KEEPS A RUNNING HISTORY OF THE STATE OF ALL THE BITS IN INPUT CHANNELS 30, 31, 32 AND 33.
# IT DOES THIS BY DETECTING A CHANGE OF AN INPUT BIT FROM AN INITIAL ONE STATE TO A ZERO STATE OR FROM AN INITIAL
# ZERO TO A ONE.  THE HISTORY IS MAINTAINED IN TWO BUFFER REGISTERS FOR EACH CHANNEL, ONE FOR STORING ONE TO ZERO
# CHANGES (30BUF1, +1, +2, AND +3) AND ONE FOR ZERO TO ONE CHANGES (30BUF0, +1 +2 AND +3).  THE OPERATOR MUST
# LOAD THE INITIAL STATES OF THE INPUT CHANNELS INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE BUFFER REGISTERS BEFORE THIS PROGRAM IS IN-
# ITIATED.
#     TO ALLOW THIS PROGRAM TO RUN C(QUITLOOK) MUST BE SET GREATER THAN +0 BEFORE IT IS STARTED.  IF THE OPERATOR
# DOES NOT DESIRE THIS PROGRAM TO RUN HE SHOULD SET C(QUITLOOK)=+0 BEFORE STARTING THE FCS TEST.  AFTER THIS TASK
# IS RUNNING THE OPERATOR CAN STOP IT BY SETTING C(QUITLOOK) = +0.
#     NO DISPLAYS OF EITHER THE BUFFER REGISTERS OR CHANNELS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROGRAM.  THIS WAS DONE TO
# ALLOW THE TEST OPERATOR MONITORING FLEXIBILITY.  FOR REAL TIME MONITORING IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE BUFFER
# REGISTERS BE DISPLAYED WITH THE MONITOR VERBS (11 THROUGH 15).  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OPERATOR MAY ELECT TO
# PERFORM NO REAL TIME MONITORING UNTIL THE TEST IS COMPLETED, WHEN THE BUFFER REGISTERS WOULD BE CALLED FOR
# DISPLAY (VERB 01) AND RECORDED.
#     THIS PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR INTERFACE MONITORING DURING THE LEM VIBRATION TEST AT BETHPAGE, N.Y.,
# ALTHOUGH IT MAY ALSO BE USEFUL DURING VEHICAL LEVEL EMI TESTS.
