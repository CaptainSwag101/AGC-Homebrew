These source-code files were reconstructed by Mike Stewart from dumps of 
the RETREAD 50 program stored in physical AGC core-rope modules (B1 and B2)
belonging to the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California.
The reconstruction was aided by pre-existing source code for the AGC programs RETREAD 44
and AURORA 12. <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Restoration.html">
<u>Read about the process here.</u></a>  Assembling this source code with
yaYUL produces core ropes identical to those of the physical modules. 
Page-number references refer to corresponding sections of RETREAD 44 source
code.  No printouts of RETREAD 50 program listings are available.  New sections of the
software (appearing in EXTENDED_VERBS_FOR_MODING.agc) have been disassembled; labels
and comments have been either taken from similar code in later programs or, in cases
where this was not possible, added by VirtualAGC for clarity.
