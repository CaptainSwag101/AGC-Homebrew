## Filename:    RADAR_LEAD-IN_ROUTINES.agc
## Purpose:     This program is designed to extensively test the Apollo Guidance Computer
##              (specifically the LM instantiation of it). It is built on top of a heavily
##              stripped-down Aurora 12, with all code ostensibly added by the DAP Group
##              removed. Instead Borealis expands upon the tests provided by Aurora,
##              including corrected tests from Retread 44 and tests from Ron Burkey's
##              Validation.
## Assembler:   yaYUL
## Contact:     Mike Stewart <mastewar1@gmail.com>.
## Website:     www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
## Mod history: 2016-12-20 MAS  Created from Aurora 12 (with much DAP stuff removed).
