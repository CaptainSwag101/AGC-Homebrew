# LUNAR AND SOLAR EPHEMERIDES SUBROUTINES

# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

#       THESE SUBROUTINES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION AND VELOCITY
#       VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT THE
#       SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME INPUT BY THE USER.

#       THE POSITION OF THE MOON IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER IN THE FORM OF
#       A NINTH DEGREE POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION WHICH IS VALID OVER A 15
#       DAY INTERVAL BEGINNING SHORTLY BEFORE LAUNCH.  THEREFORE THE TIME
#       INPUT BY THE USER SHOULD FALL WITHIN THIS 15 DAY INTERVAL.

#       LSPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON.

#       LUNPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON.

#       LUNVEL COMPUTES THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON.

#       SOLPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN.

# CALLING SEQUENCE

#       DLOAD  CALL
#              TIME               GROUND ELAPSED TIME
#              SUBROUTINE         LSPOS OR LUNPOS OR LUNVEL OR SOLPOS

# INPUT

#       1) SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME IN CS X B-28 LOADED IN MPAC.

#       2) TIMEMO - TIME AT THE CENTER OF THE RANGE OVER WHICH THE LUNAR
#          POSITION POLYNOMIAL IS VALID IN CS X B-42.

#       3) VECOEM - VECTOR COEFFICIENTS OF THE LUNAR POSITION POLYNOMIAL
#          LOADED IN DESCENDING SEQUENCE IN METERS/CS**N X B-2

#       4) RESO - POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#          TIMEMO IN METERS X B-38.

#       5) VESO - VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#          TIMEMO IN METERS/CS X B-9.

#       6) OMEGAES - ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE VECTOR RESO AT TIMEMO IN
#          REV/CS X B+26.

#       ALL EXCEPT THE FIRST INPUT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRE-LAUNCH
#       ERASABLE DATA LOAD.

# OUTPUT - LSPOS
## Page 737
#       1) 2D OF VAC AREA CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE
#          TO THE EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS X B-38.

#       2) MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#          EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS X B-29.

# OUTPUT - LUNPOS

#       MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#       EARTH AT THE TIME INPUT BY USER IN METERS X B-29.

# OUTPUT - LUNVEL

#       MPAC CONTAINS THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#       EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS/CS X B-7.

# OUTPUT - SOLPOS

#       MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH
#       AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS X B-38.

# SUBROUTINES USED

#       NONE

# REMARKS

#       THE VAC AREA IS USED FOR STORAGE OF INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL RESULTS
#       OF COMPUTATIONS.

#       S1, X1 AND X2 ARE USED BY THESE SUBROUTINES.
#       PRELAUNCH ERASABLE DATA LOAD ARE ONLY ERASABLE STORAGE USED BY
#       THESE SUBROUTINES.
#       RESTARTS DURING OPERATION OF THESE SUBROUTINES MUST BE HANDLED BY
#       THE USER.
